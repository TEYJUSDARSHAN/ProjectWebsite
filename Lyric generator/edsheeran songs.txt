Nancy mulligan
Bloodstream
Tenerife sea
Cross me
You need me i dont need you
Put it all on me
Best part of me
Kiss me
All of the stars
How would you feel
Happier
Take me back to london
Galway girl
 
Oh
When the sins of my father
Weigh down in my soul
And the pain of my mother
Will not let me go
Well, I know there can come fire from the sky
To refine the purest of kings
And even though
I know this fire brings me pain
Even so
And just the same
Make it rain
Make it rain down, Lord
Oh, make it rain
Oh, the seed needs the water
'Fore it grows out of the ground
But it just keeps on getting hard
And hunger more profound
Well, I know they can't count tears from the eye
But they may as well all be in vain
And even though I know these tears come with pain
Even so
And just the same
Well, the seas are full of water
Stops by the shore
Just like the riches of grandeur
Oh, no, no
That never reach the poor
And let the clouds fill with thunderous applause
And let lightning be the veins
And fill the sky, with all that they can draw
When it's time, to make a change
Tell me that you'll turned down the man
Who asks for your hand
'Cause you're waiting for me
And I know, you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams?
And just stay with me, ooh
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know, everything changes but
We'll be strangers if, we see this through
You could stay within these walls and bleed
Or just stay with me, oh Lord now
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one
Stumbling half drunk, getting myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
And where it goes wrong?
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one
It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the programme
I want you to be mine, lady
And to hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
For the longest time, lady
I need you, darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know?
This love is ablaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we got nothing to say
And nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singing "we found love in a local rave", no
I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out, and then hope and pray
I told her my name and said, "It's nice to meet ya"
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness
I'm in deep if anybody finds out
I'm meant to drive home, but I've drunk all of it now
Not sobering up we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another
Now she's kissing my mouth
I need you, darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know?
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushing through you
From your head to toe
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
All that I can hear is music from the back
Can you feel it?
I found you hiding here, so won't you take my hand, darling?
Before the beat kicks in again
Sing!
I need you, darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know?
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushing through you
From your head to toe
I was twenty-four years old
When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old
In that house that your brother bought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father, but her daddy said, no
You can't marry my daughter
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border
Well, I met her at Guy's in the second world war
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children now growing old
Five sons and three daughters
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border
From the snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs
You know Nancy, I adore ya
From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border
I've been spinning now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinnin' on my mind
Sipping on red wine
I've been sitting here for ages
Ripping out the pages
How'd I get so faded
Oh no no don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn
Ooh colored crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in 
Well tell when it kicks in 
I've been looking for a lover
Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord forgive me for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
And I saw scars upon her broken hearted dove
Oh no no don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn
Ooh, colored crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken hearted
Tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Broken hearted
And I saw scars upon her
You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back
We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people that talk too much
You got that kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us
Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
I'm so in love
So in love
You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness
Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
Lumiere over me
Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
And in the moment I knew you, Beth
Anything she need, she can call me
Don't worry 'bout her, that's my seed, yup, that's all me
Just know, if you cross her, then you cross me
Cross me, cross me, if you
Anything she need, she can call me
Don't worry 'bout her, that's my seed, yup, that's all me
Just know, if you cross her, then you cross me
Cross me, cross me, if you, if-
And she ain't messing with no other man
Me and her have something different
I really need all you to understand
That nobody's coming close
And I don't ever wanna run around
I spent my youth jumping in and out
But you know I fucking love her now
Like nobody ever could
And you know I stay trippin', am I crazy? Oh no
I'm sticking with my baby for sure
Together or solo
It doesn't matter where we are, oh no, no
So if you hear about my lady, just know
That she ain't the one to play with, oh no
And I'll be standing so close
So you know that, ayy
Anything she need, she can call me
Don't worry 'bout her, that's my seed, yup, that's all me
Just know, if you cross her, then you cross me
Cross me, cross me, if you, if you, if you
If you cross her
Then you cross me
And nobody's coming close, yeah
And I think that you should know that
If you cross her 
Then you cross me 
So come on and let it go
Oh, I think that you should know 
And she ain't messing with no other man
Now what you not gon' do
Is stand there 'cross from me like you got Kung Fu
Death stare, crossed arms, running your mouth like a faucet
But you don't know that my girl been doing CrossFit
Pew! Kung Pow! Get your ass with a cross kick
Blowing air out, wear you out, you exhausted
Know she gonna slide anytime you bitches talk shit
Keep a lil' blade in her fucking lip gloss kit, ayy
No one say hi to me without her
Better pay your respect to the queen
Better do that shit without a flirt
Gotta respect the HBIC
Couple of things that you need to know
If you still wanna be friends with me
Just know, if you cross her, then you cross me
Nobody's coming close, yeah
And I think that you should know that
If you cross her (anything she need, she can call me)
Then you cross me (don't worry 'bout her, that's my seed, yup, that's all me)
So come on and let it go
Oh, I think that you should know (ah, ah!)
She stay trippin', and she crazy, oh no
Quit messin' with my baby for sure
Together or solo
It doesn't matter where we are, oh no, no
So if you hear about my lady, just know
That she ain't the one to play with, oh no
And I'll be standing so close
So you know that
So come on and let it go (ah!)
Oh, I think that you should know
If you cross her (anything she need, she can call me)
Then you cross me (don't worry 'bout her, that's my seed, yup, that's all me)
Just know, if you cross her, then you cross me
Cross me, cross me, if you, if you, if you, if you, oh yeah
I still got a rucksack with the old clothes
I rap with cold flows
I'm back with the most jokes, in fact you dont know
On tracks I throw blows to make my punch lines relevant
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate
My flows developing, skin lacks the melanin
Give me shot of adrenaline and I get it in
I do it for the hell of it
Ever since I hit the mainstream with The A Team I seem to sell a bit
I took what held me back with the women and then I packaged the image
Put in some content and I then I sold it back as a gimmick
The fact is this: I'll end up dating actresses
Wake up on dirty mattresses, I think I need to practice this
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative
World's on my shoulders, I don't even know what Atlas is
Hard bars sharp like cactus is
I'm back to rap and back to back
Cause I've been practicing, I'm back to sing this
You need me man I dont need you
I said you need man I don't need 
Not none of ya', unorthodox runner up
Bring my own gear like I'm stepping on a double clutch
No brakes cut them up, the tyres stay screeching
Now I found out me and odd ain't even
I qualified for everything long straight season
It's not a dilemma kin, got a straight queeming
You are what you eat thats something to believe in
MC with the mic is MC dinner time
Now feeling gas like, MC give me light
I didn't even have to do a disco rap
I bet I still end up with a sisqo plauqe
This is what happens when you give this talent
And all you imagine, exist, imagine
I never drop shit and I came from the back end
Now I've got the game in my hand I'mma smash it
Lyrically more capable to break 'em all
I won't have to amputate a lower limb to make them fall
Like autumn, check my post mortem
The game passed away upon the day I came and killed it for this fortune
I don't mean money, I mean luck
But now the clocks aviated
Everybody's times up
Nothing's what I had and everything's what I gave
Like a sprinter near the finish line fighting for his place
Keep your diamonds and your chains
I can walk for any manner, any time of day and stay safe
Cause I get respected
While they get tested
Tell the truth there ain't nobody that done what Devs did
If you ain't on the tune or Eminem or 5'9
You ain't competition just a fish you're tryna bite a line
Ooh, I can't wait to get home
I don't know why, but I'm feelin' low
Happened again and I want you to know
Having my woman there is good for my soul
I try to be strong, well, I got demons
So can I lean on you? I need a
Strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love
It's you and only you
Who can be taken away
The shit that I gon' do
Each and everyday
When I'm alone with you
You make it better again, yeah
Your arms are where I wanna remain
Catch my eye, and she starts to say
Hey, baby, we can dance slowly
My darlin', I'll be all you need, you need
I know it hasn't been your day or week, or week, or week
So put it all on me
Oh my darling, put your worries on me
Can't judge me 'cause I feel the same thing
And I'm here for whenever you need, you need, you ne-
To put it all on me
All on me, o-o-on me
Hey baby, we can dance slowly
Put your, put your, put your worries on me
All on me, o-o-on me
Hey baby, we can dance slowly
And I'm here for whenever you need
To put it all on me
Ooh, you're there for me when I
Need you to be, 'cause I
Find it hard to say the words
But some shit don't need an explanation, baby
I tried to be strong, but I got demons
So can I lean on you? I need a
Strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love
It's you and only you
That can be taken away
The shit that I go through
Each and everyday
Baby, I can't wait
In love with all your ways
Your arms are where I wanna remain
Grab my waist when I start to say, yeah
Hey, baby, we can dance slowly
My, darlin', I'll be all you need, you need
I know it hasn't been your day or week, or week, or we-
So put it all on me
Oh my darling, put your worries on me
Can't judge me 'cause I feel the same thing
And I'm here for whenever you need, you need, you ne-
To put it all on me
Hey baby, we can dance slowly
All on me, o-o-on me
Put your, put your, put your worries on me
Hey, baby, we can dance slowly
And I'm here for whenever you need
So put it all on me
I tried to be strong, but I got demons
So can I lean on you? I need a
Strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love
My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thin and falling out of all the wrong places
I am a little insecure
My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight, day to day, I fluctuate
My skin is ink, but faded, too
But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell she love me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh, you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me?
'Cause I don't even love myself
Baby, the best part of me is you
Lately, everything's making sense too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you
I overthink and still forgive
I lose my phone and place my bits
And I never catch the train on time
Always 30 minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet
But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah, he loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me how to love myself
'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you
Lately, everything's making sense too
Baby, I'm so in love with you
With you
Da-dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum
Baby, the best part of me is you 
Lately, everything's making sense too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you 
Baby, I'm so in love with you 
Settle down with me
Cover me up
Cuddle me in
Lie down with me, yeah
And hold me in your arms
And your heart's against my chest
Your lips pressed to my neck
I'm falling for your eyes
But they don't know me yet
And with a feeling I'll forget
I'm in love now
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
Settle down with me
And I'll be your safety
You'll be my lady
I was made to keep your body warm
But I'm cold as the wind blows so hold me in your arms
My heart's against your chest
Your lips pressed to my neck
I'm falling for your eyes
But they don't know me yet
And with this feeling I'll forget
I'm in love now
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
Yeah I've been feeling everything
From hate to love
From love to lust
From lust to truth
I guess that's how I know you
So I hold you close to help you give it up
So kiss me like you wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
It's just another night
And I'm staring at the moon
I saw a shooting star
And thought of you
I sang a lullaby
By the waterside and knew
If you were here,
I'd sing to you
You're on the other side
As the skyline splits in two
I'm miles away from seeing you
I can see the stars
From America
I wonder, do you see them, too?
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home
I can hear your heart
On the radio beat
They're playing 'Chasing Cars'
And I thought of us
Back to the time,
You were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand
Back through lamp lit streets I knew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars?
Over Amsterdam
You're the song my heart is
Beating to
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home
And oh, I know, oh
I can see the stars
From America 
You are the one girl
And you know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you
We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in the front yard
We got questions we should not ask but
How would you feel, if I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time, spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too
In the summer, as the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than the river
Every moment that I spend with you
We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms round you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon
How would you feel, if I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time, spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too
We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in the front yard
We got questions we shouldn not ask
How would you feel, if I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time, spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too
Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arms
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah you look happier, you do
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal baby
If you're moving on with someone new
Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself you're happier
Aren't you?
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling I am still in love with you
But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Baby you look happier, you do
I knew one day you'd fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I'll be waiting here for you
Jet-plane headed up to the sky
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high
We ain't hit a rave in a while
So take me back to London (Yo)
I do deals, but I never get twanged
Moves that ain't ever been planned 
Know goons that were never in gangs
Where I'm from chat shit, get banged
Where I'm from chat shit, let the 12 gage rip
Yeah, it's sick how it fits in my hand
I don't mix with the glitz and the glam 
All these stupid pricks on the 'Gram
I don't do online beef, or neeky grime beef
I'm way too G'd up, to beef a grime neek
I bought an AP to help me time keep
My shooter ride deep, he moves when I speak
My shooter ride, he shoot a guy
Leave you wet like you scuba dived
You were younger then and now we unified
South London boys, get you crucified, I'm gone
It's that time
Big Mike and Teddy are on grime
I wanna try new things, they just want me to sing
Because nobody thinks I write rhymes
And now I'm back in the bits with my guy
Give me a packet of crisps with my pint
I hit my friends up, go straight to the pub
'Cause I haven't been home in time, yes, I
But that's my fault
Grossed half a billi' on the Divide tour
Yes, I ain't kidding, what would I lie for?
But now I'm back on the track with Big Michael
He said Teddy never get off your high horse
And never let 'em take your crown
I've been away for a while, travelled a million miles
But I'm heading back to London town right now
Jet plane headed up to the sky
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high
We ain't hit a rave in a while
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle night, ceilin' low
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome 
No town does it quite like my home
So take me back to London 
When I squeeze off this little pen of mine
Done the remix, now I got Ed on grime
And this ain't like any top ten of mine
I arrived at Wembley ahead of time
And that's stadiums, man are aliens
I drink supermalts and Vibranium
I got an RM11 titanium
And I rock a 5970 daily
But I want soul, I want flows
Don't need tags rippin' off my clothes
Don't need pricks blowin' up my phone
And Ted said, That's just the way things go
It's just the way things go, amazing flows
Grime or rap, man, I gave them both
Took this sound that was made in Bow
Went global, man, now the case is closed
2015 in a Badingham pub
I told Stormz two years, he'll be wrapping it up
And you'll go through tears with the people you love
But when you get to the top, man, it's never enough
'Cause you can win BRITS 
And you can do Glasto 
But when you're miles away and you're feeling alone
Gotta remember that there ain't no place like home
Jet plane headed up to the sky 
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high 
We ain't hit a rave in a while
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle night, ceilin' low 
So take me back to London
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Cèilidh singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet
A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway Girl
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway Girl
